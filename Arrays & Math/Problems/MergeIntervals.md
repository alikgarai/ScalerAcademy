# Merge Intervals
### Problem Description

    Given a set of non-overlapping intervals, insert a new interval into the intervals (merge if necessary).

    You may assume that the intervals were initially sorted according to their start times.



### Problem Constraints
    1 <= |intervals| <= 105



### Input Format
    First argument is the vector of intervals

    second argument is the new interval to be merged



### Output Format
    Return the vector of intervals after merging



### Example Input
### Input 1:

    Given intervals [1, 3], [6, 9] insert and merge [2, 5] .
### Input 2:

    Given intervals [1, 3], [6, 9] insert and merge [2, 6] .


### Example Output
### Output 1:

     [ [1, 5], [6, 9] ]
### Output 2:

     [ [1, 9] ]


### Example Explanation
### Explanation 1:

    (2,5) does not completely merge the given intervals
### Explanation 2:

    (2,6) completely merges the given intervals
