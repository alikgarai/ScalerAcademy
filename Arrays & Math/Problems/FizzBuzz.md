    Given a positive integer A, return an array of strings with all the integers from 1 to N. But for multiples of 3
    the array should have “Fizz” instead of the number. For the multiples of 5, the array should have “Buzz” instead of the number. 
    For numbers which are multiple of 3 and 5 both, the array should have "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.

    Look at the example for more details.
