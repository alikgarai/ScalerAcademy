# Sum of all Submatrices
### Problem Description

    Given a 2D Matrix A of dimensions N*N, we need to return sum of all possible submatrices.



### Problem Constraints
    1 <= N <=30

    0 <= A[i][j] <= 10



### Input Format
    Single argument representing a 2-D array A of size N x N.



### Output Format
    Return an integer denoting the sum of all possible submatrices in the given matrix.



### Example Input
    A = [ [1, 1]
          [1, 1] ]


### Example Output
    16


### Example Explanation
    Number of submatrices with 1 elements = 4, so sum of all such submatrices = 4 * 1 = 4
    Number of submatrices with 2 elements = 4, so sum of all such submatrices = 4 * 2 = 8
    Number of submatrices with 3 elements = 0
    Number of submatrices with 4 elements = 1, so sum of such submatrix = 4
    Total Sum = 4+8+4 = 16
